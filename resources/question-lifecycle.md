# Question Lifecycle 

In many cases throughout the cohort, questions, error or issues may arise that prevent completion of a workshop, task, project or the grasp of a Class Concept. Some issues are more complex than others and require a deeper dive. 

Best Practices suggest the follow flow for a question as it scales in complexity: 
1. Google It! - Most common practice of web developers
2. Ask Your Learning Team - Use the slack channel or breakout room time in class
3. Pair with a Learning Team Member - Ask one learning team member to walk through the issue along with you. Perhaps a different set of eyes is needed. _Timebox 30min_
4. Ask the entire Cohort - Use the slack channel. Perhaps someone else is having a similar issue in another team 
5. Ask a member of the Instructional Staff on Slack - Be sure to send screen shots along with a full explanation of what you're trying to do and have done to trouble shoot. _This should be included when the problem reaches anyone who doesn't have context around the question_
6. Use Office Hours to address the question - Walk through 
7. Put a Pin in it and find ways to continue to be productive. - Maybe that task will need be done a different way or maybe you'll need to use a different technology
