# Intro to Programming and Javascript  

## Quick Review: 
I have a new Coffee Making Robot. 
It is time for me to program its instructions to make coffee. 
List out the instructions using pseudocode 
*Consider* - What if I'm out of coffee? What if the coffee machine breaks?

## What is Programming 
- Creating sets instructions or directions for processes
- Concerned with transforming input into output (Calculator)
- Involves making decisions while considering lots of factors 
- Involves repetition
- Social Activity 
- Creative. Transforming thoughts and ideas into shared documents  

*Algorithm*
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

## Small Soapbox 1
_The importance of programming is rapidly growing. Our most important instutions are built on Code. Code is being taught in elementary schools, enabling younger and younger generations. We have a responsibility to program responsibility and influence younger generations to do the same_

## What is Javascript?
Javascript is a programming language developed in 1996. 
Enables us to program behaviors in response to user interactions

### Console 
Can be found under the console tab in chrome dev tools. 
It is the output of the code. We can write things to the console with 
```js
 console.log()
```
### Comments
Our way of providing context or more information outside of the code 
Critical to working with other developers 


### Primitive Data Types
- Booleans (true or false)
- Null - Given No value
- Undefined - No value given
- Numbers 
- Strings - Words and Letters

### Operators
- We can use operators on our data 
    ```js 
    + - * / < >=
    ``` 
- Concatenation 
Joining two strings Together => "My" + "Class"  => "MyClass"
Its done with the + 
```js
  "My" + "Class" //"MyClass"
```

### Variables
Named Locations to store data. 
Can be referenced over and over. 

## Errors 
When an issue occurs in your code or something is wrong with how it's written, it will throw an error. 
To fix an error, first look at the message
```js
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')' line 7
```
Take the line # and begin to search for the syntax issue on that line. 
The actual issue maybe on another line, but this is always a good place to start
