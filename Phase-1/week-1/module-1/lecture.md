## Learning Teams 
The Cohort has been divided in to small groups called Learning Teams, each led by one staff member. 
Learning Teams are meant to drive a team oriented learning within the Flipped Classroom. 
During class, we'll breakout into our Learning Teams to complete workshops, discuss Class Concepts and project work. 
Knowledge of concept grows intensely when you attempt to explain or teach that concept. 
Learning Teams are our chance to ask questions and explain answers to each other. 
Learning teams are encouraged to solve together and help eachother fully grasp Class Concepts.
