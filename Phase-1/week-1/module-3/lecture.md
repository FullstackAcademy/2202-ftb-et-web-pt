### CSS Layout
- Where is stuff positioned?
- What does a browser even do?
- display: 
  - block
  - inline
  - inline-block
  - none

### What is Normal Flow?
- It is the DEFAULT, can be overridden with CSS
- Top down, left to right

### Floats
- It takes element out of normal flow
- Pins the image to the left / right side of the screen
```css 
  clear: left;
```
Float on elements will continue. Stop this with the "clear" property. In our case, "clear: left;" on the list.

### Position
#### static
- default
- not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

### relative 
- is positioned relative to its normal position.


#### absolute
- Completely removes element from normal flow
- Offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.)
- Most useful in this case to use properties like "top" "bottom" "left" and "right" to position however you want
#### fixed
- Removes element from document flow in the same way as absolute positioning. 
- However, offsets applied from the viewport. (not containing block, like absolute)
#### sticky
- Makes an element act like 
  - position: static 

- Until it hits a defined OFFSET from the viewport, 
- At which point it acts like 
  - position: fixed.
