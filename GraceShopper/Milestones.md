# üöó Milestones

These are the major features we‚Äôre looking for at each code review, in addition to your other progress.

# üí≥ _Authorization_ 
## Backend
If a route has a `(*)` next to it, it means that it should require a logged in user to be present, if a route has a `(**)` next to it, the logged in user should be the owner of the modified object. If a route has `(*admin)` next to it, the logged in user must be an admin user (`user.isAdmin === true`).  Any `(**)` route should also be accessible by any `(*admin)` user.
## Frontend
Using the same notation above.
If a user is authorized, show the component.  If the user is not authorized, either (1) display an error message or (2) redirect the user to a different route/component (any component that would be appropriate)

# Milestones, in Vertical Slices üî™

## Stripe
#### Frontend

  - [ ] For client side, use Stripe's prebuilt [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/tutorial) form, ideally with the "Custom" strategy. We recommend [react-stripe-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stripe-checkout) in this case. Build a custom form and communicate with Stripe & your server via [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/custom-form).
  - [ ] For server side, use the [`stripe`](https://stripe.com/docs/libraries#node-library) npm library ([API docs here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/node), [tutorial here](https://stripe.com/docs/charges)) to accept tokens from your front-end app and send charges via the Stripe API.
