# Teamwork: Plan a New Project

When planning a new project, we recommend you (as a team all togetherâ€”**Everybody**):

- **Everybody**: Create any / all user stories for the win condition (you could create a GitHub milestones for each user story)
- **Everybody**: Make wireframes as needed (you could use something like [figma](https://www.figma.com/))
- **Everybody**: Come up with schema designs (you could use something like [genmymodel](https://www.genmymodel.com/database-diagram-online))
