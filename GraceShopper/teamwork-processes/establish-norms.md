# Teamwork: Establish Norms

When starting a new team project, we recommend:

1. **Anybody**: create a google doc / shareable text file somewhere and share it with the whole team 
2. **Everybody**: go through [Establishing Norms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YOpRdI4d_jPBCnt2pO1rYibInkpFhBrITixKGxtBIk0/edit?usp=sharing), answering the questions and using them to guide your norms discussion
3. **Everybody**: look over our [example team contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qBZeAX6gzYPyxdIVHNoP2HTF1ZUUf3seU0cIiBJTT1c/edit?usp=sharing) to continue the discussion
4. **Anybody**: put a permanent link to the norms somewhere everybody has access to it
